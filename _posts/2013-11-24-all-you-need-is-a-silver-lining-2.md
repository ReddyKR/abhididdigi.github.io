<p>I&#8217;m not a very big fan of Romantic movies. If you had followed my<a href="http://blog.daab.in/post/57249961865/those-movies-i-dig"> previous posts</a>, you will very well know that I&#8217;m more of a Drama fan. Heck I don&#8217;t even blog movies once I watch them. But this movie is special.</p>

<p>When <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1045658/">Silver Linings Playbook</a> was out, I was reluctant to go watch it, inspite of it having an excellent cast with Robert De Niro( I&#8217;ve almost watched all the movies of his), Bradley Cooper, the charming Jennifer Lawrence  and even Anupam Kher. I was really <em>really</em> impressed with Limitless with both De Niro and Cooper. I was avoiding this movie for two particular reasons. One obviously is that, this movie is a Romance, and the second  that it stars Jennifer Lawrence. Earlier I&#8217;ve watched two movies starring Jennifer in the lead role, Hunger games and Winter&#8217;s Bone. While Winter&#8217;s Bone is a  movie you definitely  should watch, Hunger games is one of the worst movies I had seen in IMAX, Hyderabad. Yes, on the big screen. So I really wasn&#8217;t expecting much from her in this movie. God, I was so wrong.</p>

<p>If you hadn&#8217;t watched the movie. You should. This movie is finding the right person for you, family, why family is important, and more specifically about love.</p>

<p>Jennifer Lawrence looks really good in the role of Tiff. Both Cooper and Lawrence pair works so very well. Two screens to sum the movie up.</p>

  <p>Life reaches out a moment like this, it is a sin to not reach back. You are facing a big challenge in your life right now, this very moment. This girl(Tiff) loves you. I don&#8217;t know if Nikki ever did.</p>

  <p>Dear Tiffiny,
  I know you wrote the letter. Only way you can meet my crazy, was doing something crazy yourself. Thank you. I love you. I knew it the minute I met you. I&#8217;m sorry it took me so long to catch up. I was stuck.</p>
