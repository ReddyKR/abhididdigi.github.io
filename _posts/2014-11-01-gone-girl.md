======================================================
Yesterday Oct 31, 2014 Friday, I was feeling very lazy in the evening and thought that I can get some air and see some Halloween Action. So I took an Uber to NYC and then walked the streets till its 10:00 in the night. I didn't have my dinner yet, so thought I could get some food in Newport Mall, Jersey City. At 10:00 in the night almost all the shops were closed. The only thing that was opened was the Newport theatre. I thought I would as well see a movie to complete my Friday night out. 

I wasn't able to decide between John Wick, which I hear (from Reddit) that it's slick and very good. The other movie was David Fincher's Gone Girl. I went along with Gone Girl not only because it was directed by Fincher but also has Ben Affleck in it. I wasn't disappointed. 

The movie focuses on the perils of Domestic Abuse. I wouldn't say it is as good as other movies by Fincher like The Game, Fight Club etc. but it looks okay. 

One thing I really kept thinking in the movie is that the character of Detective Rhonda Boney was inspired from the character of Marge Gunderson from Coen Brother's Fargo. She is a police women, she spoke Southern Accent AND she likes coffee. That's the effect Coen Brothers have on you. I first thought David took the character base from Fargo. Later I gather that this movie was taken from a book, and now I think that Author took this Character from Fargo.

Over all, the movie was okay. Acting was top notch. Only thing I was very disappointed was how abruptly Mr. Fincher ended the movie.  I was waiting for more. It never came. Also like many other movies like Shutter Island the movie doesn't have a complete ending. This technique is very good for movies like Shutter Island where the movie gives the Audience a choice on  what they want to believe the ending is. This movie is different, the audience know the result. They are waiting for something to be done to stop that result and that never came. I think that's where Scorseseâ€™s better than Fincher. He knows when to end a movie.

Fincher as I have mentioned in numerous blog posts and discussions is one of my favorite Directors. He has a unique style for screenplay, some he takes from Nolan, some from Scorsese. The parallel narration was very well done. I wasn't just one parallel narration going on, there are two from two different viewpoints. And he does a better job than Nolan. Some Nolan's movies seem complex and need viewing once or twice, but Fincher's style sinks right in. You get every single thing in the movie. 

All in all it was a good movie, you can go watch it twice and I would give it a rating of 8 on 10.
