======================================================




<p>Daily, I&#8217;m learning a little bit about myself. That I&#8217;m a bad coder. I code and test it directly on PROD. and I write code that cannot be maintained.</p>

<p>The recent example of this was when I coded a functionality for the client I&#8217;m working for using Backbone js and did some heavy lifting, when there is no real reason to use Backbone js, I could&#8217;ve gotten away with jQuery. But I made it complex, and wrote it using Backbone.js - Hence the code that needed to be some 20 lines of code, span across 60+ lines.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m trying to say is not that Backbonejs is more complex, but when working with applications which are simple, and don&#8217;t need MVC - like adding a row to a table using a button, You don&#8217;t need to use backbone.js.  As Douglas Crawford in his book <strong>Javascript: The Good parts</strong>  rightly puts, don&#8217;t use all the features because you know them. Use them if you feel they are right to be used in that instance.</p>

<p>And the person who is going to maintain it should know Backbone.js to maintain my code.</p>

<p>Bad ain&#8217;t it?</p>
