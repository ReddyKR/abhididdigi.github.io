title: The virtue of Credibility
--- 



 {{post.title}}
======================================================




This post is not about Credibility, instead it is about a person who taught me what credibility is.  A mentor. A manager, and a loving friend. I have searched for many names to this blog post, but choose the current one, because that&#8217;s what that person stands for. He taught me what Credibility is. He taught some more good things in life. He taught me and showed me that we have to take responsibilities for the actions we take.  He taught me the value of treating people right. 

 <br/> 

<blockquote>Don&#8217;t just remember people who were in your life. Remembrance is useless. It&#8217;s following what they taught you in your time together that gets some meaning and importance to their role in your life.</blockquote>

 <br/> 

 <b><u>Inception</u></b> 

 <b><br/></b> 

 I was working in one of the not-so-good projects of my life. The salary was good, and I get to live in the United States and so   I kept working. I being a very junior developer, who really doesn&#8217;t know how to say &#8216;no&#8217; drove my client manager to get some one to manage the project that I&#8217;m working on and manage me and the overall project. That was when I met him. I don&#8217;t clearly remember what my first thoughts were about this person. I know for sure, I will remember the last thoughts when this person left, for the rest of my life. And as I said above, remembrance isn&#8217;t enough.  

 <br/> 

 <br/> 

 <br/> 

 <b><u>What he taught me</u></b> 

 <b><u><br/></u></b> 

 I don&#8217;t want to get into what I did with my time with him and my life around him. Those are the boring details; But I do want to go write that, he always used to take us to lunch, feed us with ice-creams and lots of other stuff. He introduced me to Italian and Chinese food.  

 <br/> 

 Apart from all of this, he did teach me a whole lot, without actually teaching me. 

 <br/> 

 He taught me what it&#8217;s actually being a good manager: 

 <br/> 

 A good manager doesn&#8217;t play office politics. A good manager is straightforward. A good manager is a person who you work with and not for. A good manager makes you feel that you matter too. A good manager doesn&#8217;t think twice to punish you when you make deliberate mistakes. A good manager is responsible and credible. This person is an embodiment of all these qualities. He is very simple,- Zen like.  I had a complete different opinion on what manager is, he changed all of that. 

 <br/> 

 <u><b>What I learnt</b></u> 

 <br/> 

 <br/> 

 - Credibility does matter:  Never promise what you cannot deliver. If you lose credibility you lose everything. Learn saying &#8216;no&#8217; if you think you cannot do something, but don&#8217;t promise. 

 <br/> 

 - Speak truth always, and be straightforward: There is no point to not be straight forward. If you don&#8217;t want to hurt someone be very polite and graceful, like the great poem from Sumathi Setakam&#160;: 

 <br/> 

<blockquote>నొప్పించక తానోప్పక తప్పించుకు తిరుగువాడే నీర్పరి సుమతీ!</blockquote>

 You will hurt yourself if you don&#8217;t speak truth. You will have to remember everything you say or do, to cover up the lies. If you aren&#8217;t straightforward you either un-necessarily burdening yourself.  Be gentle and polite. 

 <br/> 

 - Don&#8217;t do something you don&#8217;t like. It&#8217;s better to leave than to continue doing something you dislike. What ever your state is. 

 <br/> 

 - Be consistent - He always comes to office at 7:30 in the morning. Always. While I was here, I never saw him coming late. He would even prefer take Work from Home than come late. And when he does work from home, he connects early in the morning at 8.  

 <br/> 

 <b><u>What I would practice?</u></b> 

 <br/> 

 I would try to meet every promise I make, I will not promise something I wouldn&#8217;t meet. 

 <br/> 

 I would start being strightforward, what ever the price is. 

 <br/> 

 I will be consistent in what I do. 

 <br/> 

  

 <br/> 

 Dan, I liked working with you so much. In our limited time together, you taught me more than any person other than my parents taught me. You were genuine and simple. You were always strightforward and true to yourself and the people around you. I now know why you made so many friends at work in these 23 years. You are a people&#8217;s person. You genuienly care about the people who you work with.  

 <br/> 

 <br/> 

 And being a people&#8217;s person isn&#8217;t the only thing that makes you special. You are logical and you always ask the right questions. I haven&#8217;t seen a person who caught up on something that is so new to them in such short time.  

 <br/> 

 <br/> 

 <br/> 

 We both miss you. Take care and have fun. All the best and enjoy the rest of your life.
