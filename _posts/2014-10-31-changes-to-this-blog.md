======================================================




When I first started back in 2010, I thought ServiceNow is going to be an awesome Developer friendly tool. Over the years, ServiceNow did evolve as a "tool", but it started becoming more of a _closed_ tool. In **Calgary** there is very less developer intervention needed to get a beautiful implementation. Meaning ServiceNow is moving towards that model where it no longer need any Implementation Specialists needed to do the stuff in it. All it needes is a bunch of  ServiceNow admins to do basic functions.

So, I started feeling, that there is not much growth for me from a Career Prespective in this tool for long. I am not going to become good at any language if I keep working on this tool. I don't know where I might see myself if I keep working on this tool in the next 5 years.

Also the circumstances today are different. Community has grown and it's notanymore like what it was back in 2010, so I don't feel a need for this site anymore as you can always find what you find here on the ServiceNow community.


Therefore, this blog will no longer be a pure ServiceNow technical blog. This blog is going to be about my personal life too.
