title: A Dubious Proposition

 {{post.title}}
======================================================




So, as mentioned in an earlier post, I'm slowly distancing myself from ServiceNow. I've already mentioned the reason on why. ServiceNow is becoming more of a "closed" source tool. I personally for one believe you might get lot of money customizing this tool, but if you are really inclined towards programming you might want to move away from this tool.

Also, the new Share app site promotes more and more apps meaning there will be lot of pre-written stuff that you can just export and import into your instance. So everybody can do development and there is not much for a skilled programmer to do in the tool. 

Thirdly, there is abundance of folks doing ServiceNow now. I don't see community any more as a closely knit community. I don't know the reason for this. I really don't feel the same as the old community anymore.

You might call me purist all you want but I really somehow feel something isn't right. The tool is saturated. ServiceNow folks doesn't want the implementation specialists do anything crazy. For example JSON API was entirely written in ServiceNow Script Include to which everybody had access to, now slowly they are moving it to a Java implementation thereby the source code isn't available to anybody. I understand this might primarily because of Performance, too.

Net to net, the main reason to this is that, I don't want anymore to be a "ServiceNow" guy through out my life. I want to getout and do something else. 

I'm not saying I will stop working completely on ServiceNow. I'm saying I don't want to completely spend my time on ServiceNow. 

If you are new to ServiceNow and you find ServiceNow awesome, good for you. You have a long and good career in ServiceNow, atleast for the next 10 years.

**So what is that I want to do now?**

The proposition is, I would like to learn some languages, contrubite to some quality code on Github. I'm eyeing Javascript, Rust and Python. I do have some hands on on both Javascript and Python but I'm just a begginer in both the languages. I am very new to Rust. I will post what I'm and where I'm in coming days.
