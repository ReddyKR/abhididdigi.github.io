======================================================




<p>A lot of my friends, especially @fab4rockz that this movie doesn&#8217;t fall under the category of a typical X-Men movie, and you will not find much action. And he is right about the movie not having much of an action, but the movie is far from uninteresting.</p>

<p>The storyline is interesting, the present X Men will be hunted and terminated by bots called &#8220;Sentinals&#8221;. And these Sentinals are so powerful because, they are modified and built based upon the DNA of <em>Mystic</em> , the power that allows her to change her physical features will be used to build the <em>Sentinals</em> so that they can adapt to the arsenal of prowess of all the X-Men.</p>

<p>So, <em>Kitty Pride</em> ( that girl who can send people back in time, if you are wondering) takes <em>Logan</em> back in time, so that he can stop <em>Mystic</em> from getting captured.</p>

<p><em>Bryan Singer</em> did a great job. He used the technique of Parallell narrations (just like that of Christopher Nolan) to narrate both the present and past stage, and there is a point where both the past and present will intersect, and they diverge again. So it&#8217;s like the past and present will converge at one point, and then diverge all over again.</p>

<p>You will from this movie get a better understanding of <em>Logan</em>, <em>Mystic</em> and <em>Charles Xavier</em>, but <em>Magento</em>'s nature remain a mystery to me.</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend watching it.</p>
