 {{post.title}}
======================================================




<p>I&#8217;ll lay out straight and clear what posts you need to post on Facebook and what you shouldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve been using Facebook for almost 6 years now(from 2008) I&#8217;ve had my share of ups and downs when using Facebook.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/eaIaoez.jpg"/></p>

<p>This is mostly going to be my last blog post for 2013, so I thought i would write some good words, help some folks with what I had learnt in recent years. Also, now that your employers, before they hire you are looking at your Social profiles(Facebook, twitter) it&#8217;s time you be very careful on what you share. And the biggest shock this year - NSA snooping on you, accessing all the information, looking at your photos is really something you need to keep in mind before you share something over the internet. Remember this&#160;: Once a thing is on internet, it stays forever. It&#8217;s worse with Facebook, even though you delete your profile, Facebook still <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/facebook-does-not-erase-user-deleted-content/4808">keeps all</a> the information that belongs to your profile.</p>

<h2>With these in mind, here are few things you should NOT share on Facebook:</h2>

<h5>1. Don&#8217;t share your relationship problems.</h5>

<p>No really. Nobody is interested in your relationship problems. Plain and clear. There are few people in your life genuinely interested in your problem, your family, your friends - and these people don&#8217;t need to know about your problems through Facebook. The rest of your &#8220;friend list&#8221; in facebook, doesn&#8217;t even know the context of your problem. So if you post your problem on Facebook, you might be doing it for two reasons.</p>

<p>a) You want to tell everybody you are having a problem and want them to help(?!) you (or) feel bad with you?</p>

<p>Who in this world doesn&#8217;t have problems? If your problem is something like you are in need of money for medical or any other operations, or you need a job/need a house for rent etc., for sure put it on Facebook, there are tons and tons good people out there[1], who are ready to help you. I would help you, those kinds of problems tell us how there is still good in this world, to help you with your problem. But relationship problems, seriously? Like your and your girlfriend had a fight? Like some person bitched about you to others, and you want to bitch about him and/or tell everybody how awesome you are in-spite of they bitching about you? Go talk to your girlfriend/ or this person and settle the matter. Why in the name of God are you Facebooking it? So your friends will know the other person is bad and so they stop talking to them? Not going to happen. The best that can happen is they block you for meaning less and context less messages.</p>

<p>After all this if you still feel that the pixelating your problem is your solution, go head - But not on Facebook - there are other venues, exactly for those kinds of things[2].</p>

<p>b) You need other person who hurt you to know you are feeling bad(?!)</p>

<p>As I said - Facebooking the problem never really solved any problem.Talk to the your girlfriend/your friend and sort things out.</p>

<p>If you have a relationship problem either DGAF(because haters are gonna hate - Plato) , or go talk to the person who created it or tell that to your family. I still remember the advice given by my dad when I had no where else to go. I didn&#8217;t tell him about the problem, but he saw it in me, he came, he hugged me and he said -&#8220;Stop worrying about it, Nothing happened. After all this, the sun still rises in east and sets in west.&#8221;,I remember that day to this day. If there is no one else, call me. I&#8217;ll be on 91-9505230804. I had lots of help when I was in problems, and I will be glad to help you.</p>

<h5>2. Don&#8217;t facebook very personal photos:</h5>

<p>I did this - There are lots of personal photos with my friends on Facebook and I sometimes feel bad for it. With NSA thing and facebook being a suspicious company, I wouldn&#8217;t share ANY personal photos on Facebook. If you want to show all your friends, yes store them on a server you own and then share that link in there. Though there is a slight problem that Facebook will cache the thumbnails of these photos when you share them, there is no big problem with this.</p>

<p>Till this day I don&#8217;t have a single photo of my family on Facebook.</p>

<h5>3. Post your views but don&#8217;t become very aggressive, it&#8217;s not worth it:</h5>

<p>Post your views, your music, share things which are good, funny, things which people enjoy. These things are great! That is why something which is funny, sweet or beautiful always gets noticed. But when disagreeing, always always follow these rules by Paul Graham[3]. There is a hierarchy of rules that you need to follow when you disagree. This way you will stay out in the clear and people still enjoy the conversation.</p>

<p>I became very aggresive way back in 2009 and started putting statuses on Telanagana, people who are for-telangana. Now people who read my statuses will read me as a douche. Because all I did in most of those posts was name calling.</p>

<h1>Things you SHOULD share on Facebook</h1>

<p>1) Share the good things of your life. Share good places you went to, Post pictures(carefully) of funny things. Facebook is an excellent medium where you can tell everybody the good things of your life, and if everybody starts following this every one of us will start learning something good about everybody and we grow. That&#8217;s why they say, &#8216;sharing is caring&#8217; with a caveat &#8216;sharing (good things) is caring&#8217;</p>

<h5>And finally if you think you are wasting lot of time on Facebook, here is something that I&#8217;ve tried to reduce my visits to Facebook and finally stop them.</h5>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have 600 friends on your Facebook. Everyday your wall will aggregate things from all your friends and you read each and every one of them. Now what you have to do is, remove at least 10 friends whose feed is being posted on to your wall from your feed. i.e., go to those profiles and un-check &#8220;show in my news feed&#8221;. That way the next day, their posts will not come on to your wall. Repeat this again and again so that you finally end up with some 10-20 friends who really matter to you. That way the time within which your Facebook wall refreshes with new feed reduces, and there by the you will not see anything new when you open your Facebook which will result in decreasing  your craving for opening Facebook. I&#8217;ve tried this for 6 months which is working just fine, I open Facebook very less when compared to what I used to do.</p>

<p>This works because, you Facebooking is a habit and to remove a habit you have to stop flaming its craving, which is what we are doing exactly.</p>

<p>tl;dr; Don&#8217;t put relationship problems, don&#8217;t put personal photos, don&#8217;t spread hate. Spread love, happiness and humor. You will live a long and ever lasting life with a bunch of kids and a happy wife/husband.</p>
